Dude, I have heard something about you.

2
00:00:38.00 --> 00:00:40.000
What?

3
00:00:41.00 --> 00:00:42.00
You know what.

4
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:47.00
Did my mom tell you?

5
00:00:51.00 --> 00:00:55.00
Yes. Well, she might not have told you that I was forced. Okay?

6
00:00:57.00 --> 00:01:01.00
God man, she can’t keep anything to herself. She’s driving me crazy man.

7
00:01:03.00 --> 00:01:10.00
She came to London ten days ago and took me to some friend's relative's place to see a girl: Neelu Aunty and Gogi Uncle’s daughter, Cookie.

8
00:01:11.00 --> 00:01:18.00
I had decided that I would go, drink tea, say “thank you Uncle and thank you Aunty”, say “no”, and then leave

9
00:01:19.00 --> 00:01:23.00
As soon as we took the first sip of tea, Cookie said “no”. (stuttering) So… you know…

8
00:01:24.00 --> 00:01:25.00
What?

9
00:01:25.00 --> 00:01:26.00
I mean so what, what is there?

10
00:01:28.00 --> 00:01:36
(Laughing) What?! (Continue laughing) Come on man.

11
00:01:38.00 --> 00:01:41.00
You went for an arranged marriage… and got rejected and came back?

12
00:01:42.00 --> 00:01:45.00
I didn’t create an impression - you can’t! No no no no, now you are just saying it. I didn't want to impress her!

13
00:01:46.00 --> 00:01:50.00
You have ruined the reputation of our group. Shut up, please stop it!

14
00:01:52.00 --> 00:01:54.00
What reason was there to tell you?! What’s wrong with her?

15
00:01:55.00 --> 00:02:00.00
Actually, aunty didn’t tell him anything. This is his new trick and you’re his latest trick’s victim.

16
00:02:01.00 --> 00:02:02.00
Cheers. Cheers.
